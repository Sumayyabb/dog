                <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <p>Greetings!<br>
                    My name is Syeda Summiya Bukhari, born and raised in Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab which is the 17th largest city of Pakistan and situated on the borders of three provinces Sindh, Baluchistan and Punjab. We are a total of seven siblings. I am the fourth child of the family and also have a twin brother. My date of birth is 7th of July, 1998. I have completed my matriculation from Allied school in 2015 and in 201 I have completed my intermediate from Government Girls Degree College Rahim Yar Khan. After that in 2017 I got admission in FAST-NUCES Karachi so I shifted from beloved city to the 2nd largest metropolitan city. Currently I am in final year of Bachelors of Computer Science program and will graduate in June 2021, hopefully. <br>

                <h1>WHY AM I DIFFERENT?</h1>
                <p><br>
                    I like to be creative that somehow builds my interest in sketching and photography. I love to draw what comes in my mind which I sometimes unable to express through words. I like to hold a pencil and draw on paper most of the time. An artist is the most sensitive form of the human being who understands everyone but people often unable to understand them. I never want to leave my family but to have a degree from a reputable institute and make them proud I have to away.  That needs a lot of courage and strength but as a sensitive individual I also have it in me. That strength makes me different; the motivation of making my family proud makes me different. I am eager to complete the degree on time.   <br>

                <h1>WHAT CAN I CONTRIBUTE</h1>
                <p><br>
                    Also I have set some goals from myself. I have a keen interest in sketching, so I also learnt the graphic designing which was initially my passion. It brings me joy. It opens my mind and allow me to be as creative as I want which gives me a piece of mind ultimately helps me carrying a hectic life in this loud city.  So now when I graduate, I will be the girl who can code and design. This line is my motivation <br>
